# VSCode Transmitter Extension

Rebar has built in support for the `Rebar Transmitter` extension.

This allows you to open a scratchpad under `src/scratchpad` and write code.

Once the code is written you can `SELECT THE CODE WITH YOUR CURSOR` and then right-click to execute it while the server is running.
